## About Me  
I'm a data analyst with experience working across sectors like public health, agriculture and real estate development. I currently work at **Home Builders Research Inc.**, where I help builders and developers in Las Vegas make smarter decisions using data from housing trends and public records.

I’ve also supported major research projects implemented by Precise Trends Research & Consulting Limited, in collaboration with organizations like UNICEF, WFP, ILO, OXFAM and Marie Stopes Kenya turning raw survey data into actionable insights that drive sustainable development..

I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and bring clarity to complexity. I believe the best insights are the ones that make a real impact and that’s what drives my work.

##  Highlight Projects  
Here are a few pinned projects you’ll find on my profile:

[MaliYaLeo: Market-Price-Planning-Assistant-for-Kenyan-Consumers-and-Farmers](https://github.com/Abishang21/MaliYaLeo)

Collaborated on developing a data-driven solution to provide real-time and forecasted market prices for key food commodities in Kenya. Utilized ML models (Ridge Regression, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM) to predict price trends 7 days in advance, enhancing decision-making for farmers, traders and households. Deployed via USSD and Web Dashboard for inclusive access even in rural areas without smartphones or internet.

[AI-Powered Health Insurance Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Abishang21/AI-Powered-Health-Insurance-Fraud-Detection)

Collaborated on building an end-to-end pipeline for detecting Medicare fraud using unsupervised machine learning and explainable AI. Leveraged CMS datasets to identify suspicious billing patterns through anomaly detection and clustering, providing interpretable outputs to support audits and regulatory reporting.

[Personalized Meal Type Prediction](https://github.com/Abishang21/Personalized-Meal-Type-Prediction)

Built a classification model using Food.com data to predict meal types (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dessert) based on user preferences. Supports personalization for meal kit services.
