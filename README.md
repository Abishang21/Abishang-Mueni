## About Me  
I'm a data analyst and researcher with experience working on projects in public health, gender & disability inclusion, food security, agriculture and housing.

Currently, I work at Home Builders Research Inc. (Las Vegas), where I analyze housing and construction datasets to help builders and developers make smarter decisions. Previously, I supported research and evaluation projects at Precise Trends Research & Consulting Ltd., working with partners like UNICEF, WFP, ILO, Oxfam and Marie Stopes Kenya to transform raw survey data into actionable insights for sustainable development.

For me, the best insights aren‚Äôt just numbers they‚Äôre the ones that inform better policies, empower communities and create lasting impact. That belief drives my work every day.

My Superpowers:
- Transforming messy datasets into clean, reliable insights using Excel, Python (Pandas) and SQL

- Visualizing trends and stories through Power BI, Tableau, and Excel

- Applying machine learning techniques (forecasting, classification, anomaly detection)

- Coordinating large-scale, multi-country data collection and ensuring high data quality

##  Highlight Projects  
Here are a few pinned projects you‚Äôll find on my profile:

[Aircraft Risk and Safety Analysis](https://github.com/Abishang21/Aircraft-Risks-Analysis)

Conducted analysis of global aviation accident data to uncover safety risks and guide aircraft acquisition decisions. Processed accident records with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and built Tableau dashboards highlighting high-risk aircraft models, accident-prone flight phases and weather-related vulnerabilities. Findings equipped leadership with data-driven recommendations for safer fleet investments and proactive risk management.

[MaliYaLeo: Market-Price-Planning-Assistant-for-Kenyan-Consumers-and-Farmers](https://github.com/Abishang21/MaliYaLeo)

Collaborated on developing a data-driven solution to provide real-time and forecasted market prices for key food commodities in Kenya. Utilized ML models (Ridge Regression, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM) to predict price trends 7 days in advance, enhancing decision-making for farmers, traders and households. Deployed via USSD and Web Dashboard for inclusive access even in rural areas without smartphones or internet.

[AI-Powered Health Insurance Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Abishang21/AI-Powered-Health-Insurance-Fraud-Detection)

Collaborated on building an end-to-end pipeline for detecting Medicare fraud using unsupervised machine learning and explainable AI. Processed large-scale CMS healthcare billing datasets and applied clustering & anomaly detection to flag suspicious claims. Produced interpretable outputs to support audits, compliance checks and regulatory decision-making, helping safeguard healthcare systems against financial abuse.
