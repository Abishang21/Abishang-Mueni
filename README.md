## 💡 About Me  
I'm a data analyst with 4+ years of experience working across sectors like public health, agriculture, and real estate development. I currently work at **Home Builders Research Inc.**, where I help builders and developers in Las Vegas make smarter decisions using data from housing trends and public records.

I’ve also supported major research projects implemented by Precise Trends Research & Consulting Limited, in collaboration with organizations like UNICEF, WFP, ILO, OXFAM and Marie Stopes Kenya turning raw survey data into actionable insights that drive sustainable development..

I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and bring clarity to complexity. I believe the best insights are the ones that make a real impact—and that’s what drives my work.
